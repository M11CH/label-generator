LABEL GENERATOR - WOODEN PRODUCT

This program was created to simplify the process of creating product
pricing labels.  With a CSV file containing information to be printed
out on the labels, the program is able to extract product detail and
create a PDF document according to user's needs.

# Getting started #
###################

If working on a Windows PC, you must first download Cygwin in order to
be able to run the program in Linux enviroment. Once Cygwin is up and
running, make sure you have Python 3 installed with the following
modules:
- reportlab

Once all above features are installed, go ahead and download all the
files included in this repository. Once you have everything saved,
navigate inside the folder containing all the downloaded files via the
command line interface.



###########
# Testing #
###########

You have downloaded some sample data needed to run the program, to
check if the progam is functioning properly, run the following command
inside your directory containing all the files:

./makelabels.py sampledata.csv
And enter the following when prompted:
>>>Filter by: RED-OAK

The expected outcome of this command is a new PDF file inside your
directory titled RED-OAK.pdf containing labels which should look the
same as the sample PDF file.

# Deployment #
##############

- LOGO
In order for the labels to contain your logo, replace the
"logo.png" file in the repository with your own PNG file with the same
name. Optimal image size is 352x97 pixels.

- CSV DATA
In order to produce the labels you need to provide a CSV
file containing product information in a specific format:
-- CSV format
   Column 1: product code
   Column 2: product description*
   Column 3: product cost (optional)
   Column 4: product sell price (including currency symbol eg. $)

   * product description must be of the following format:
     	     - size/width: width of a plank in following pattern
	       		   0 or 0-0/0 or 0-0/00 or 0-0/0+0-0/0
			   (each 0 represnets any integer eg. 4-1/4)
																		- species: species of wood such as RED-OAK, this is used
			to filter the data for the labels, if CSV file
			contains more than one species, this is how the
			program will know which labels to produce. If
			more than one word is used, they must be joined
			by a "-"
	     - color: used for sorting labels by colour, all of data
	       	      containing the same species and color will be printed
		      on the same label
	     - material: eg. solid or engineered wood. Each label will
	       		 contain different widhts of the plank together with
			 corresponding material and its price printed
			 underneath its title which is the species and color
			 relative to the plank

   Please see "sampledata.csv" to confirm applicable formats.

- RUNNING THE PROGRAM
In the command line enviroment, navigate inside
the directory containing the program and type the following command:
./makelabels.py sampledata.csv
      ^              ^
   program 	  csv file
